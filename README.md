**Title:** Used Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression

**Description:**
---
This project utilizes linear regression to predict used car prices based on various features such as mileage, engine volume, brand, body type, engine type, and registration status. The code includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, handling missing values and outliers, checking assumptions, and creating a linear regression model. The dataset is cleaned, features are scaled, and the model is trained and tested. The repository also provides a practical example using a Jupyter notebook with explanations for each step.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, dropping unnecessary columns, and dealing with outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing and analyzing the distribution of variables using histograms and scatter plots.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Building a linear regression model to predict log-transformed car prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Checking model performance on training and testing data, visualizing predictions vs. targets.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating dummy variables for categorical features and addressing multicollinearity.
- **GitHub Repository Structure:** Well-organized structure for easy navigation and understanding.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **IDE:** PyCharm Community Edition
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, DataSpell, Datalore

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in an environment that supports data science tools (e.g., PyCharm, DataSpell, or Jupyter).
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to understand and execute each part of the code.
4. Explore the data, preprocess it, and train/test the linear regression model.
5. Gain insights into the model's performance and predictions.
